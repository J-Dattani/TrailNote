# TrailNote üîñ

TrailNote is a small, privacy-first Chrome extension (Manifest V3) designed to help you capture and organize quick page snapshots while you browse and research. It focuses on short, readable captures ‚Äî headings, bullets, and short summaries ‚Äî so you can build a compact trail of the pages you visited and quickly export a shareable PDF.

![TrailNote Icon](icons/icon-128.png)

## What is it? ‚ú®

TrailNote captures a lightweight summary of pages you visit and stores up to five recent captures per session. It's targeted at researchers and information gatherers who want a fast way to collect page metadata (title, headings, bullets, author, date) and export a compact, readable PDF of their browsing trail.

> NOTE: This project is in a *premature* stage. It works for many pages but still needs refinements, better noise filtering across sites, richer export features (images, video links), and community testing.

## Key features (current)

- Capture page title, URL, time, short summary, headings, and bullets.
- Keep up to 5 recent captures in the current session.
- Simple popup UI to view session captures and export a cleaned PDF.
- Local-first processing ‚Äî summarization and extraction are performed locally in the extension where possible, to respect privacy.
- Easy quick-add via context menu selection (right-click ‚Üí add to Browsing/Research).

- PDF export: experimental and currently known to be unreliable. Please do not rely on PDF downloads yet ‚Äî PDF output and the export experience are being actively improved. If you hit blank PDFs or formatting issues, please file an issue on GitHub and we will prioritize fixes.

## Roadmap / Planned improvements üöÄ

- Better PDF exports with richer formatting and clickable links.
- Include images and video links in captures when present on the page.
- Smarter deduplication and per-site noise filtering.
- Improved summarization options (short vs. long) and export templates.
- Support for syncing or saving sessions externally (opt-in).

## Who is this for?

- Researchers scanning academic papers, blogs, and long-form web content.
- People who want a compact history of what they read without full browser history noise.
- Anyone who needs quick snapshots and simple shareable notes from web browsing sessions.

## Privacy & data

TrailNote is designed to process data locally where possible. Captures are stored in Chrome's local extension storage and are not sent to any external server by default. If you contribute features that add remote sync, those will be opt-in and clearly documented.
